    "## Introduction\n",
    "Ad serving machines produce two types of log files: `impression logs` and `click logs`. Every time we display an advertisement to a customer, we add an entry to the impression log. Every time a customer clicks on an advertisement, we add an entry to the click log.\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to combine the click and impression logs into a single table that specifies if there was a click for a specific ad and information about that click.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log data is stored on s3 in the elasticmapreduce bucket `s3://elasticmapreduce/samples/hive-ads/` and includes subdirectories called `tables/impressions` and `tables/clicks`. The directories contain additional directories named such that we can access the data as a partitioned table within Hive. The naming syntax is `[Partition column]` = `[Partition value]`. For example: dt=2009-04-13-05.\n",
